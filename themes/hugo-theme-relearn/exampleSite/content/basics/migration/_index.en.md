Everything else can and should be deleted from your custom stylesheet to assure everything works fine. For the predefined stylesheet variants, this change is already included. The [documentation]({{%relref "basics/customization/#mine-variant" %}}) was adjusted accordingly.

## 2.0.0

- **Change**: Syntaxhighlightning was switched to [built in Hugo mechanism](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/). You may need to configure a new stylesheet or decide to roll you own as describedd on in the Hugo documentation

- **Change**: In the predefined stylesheets there was a typo and `--MENU-HOME-LINK-HOVERED-color` must be changed to `--MENU-HOME-LINK-HOVER-color`.

- **Change**: `--MENU-HOME-LINK-color` and `--MENU-HOME-LINK-HOVER-color` were missing in the documentation. You should add them to your custom stylesheets.
